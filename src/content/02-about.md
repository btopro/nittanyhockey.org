## Joining a team
If you are interested in joining a team, start coming out to one of the pick-up games to meet other players and find out which teams might need a player. You can also send a note to the NHL league leaders using the contact form on the website. Teams play roughly 20 games in the fall and another 20 games in the spring. $18 per game is a good estimate of expected charges.
